##  Important Notes

- **Privacy First**: All your journal entries and data are stored locally in your browser using localStorage. Nothing is ever sent to any server or database.
- **Device-Specific**: Data saved on one device won't automatically appear on another device. Each browser/device maintains its own separate journal.
- **Browser Data**: Clearing your browser's cache/data will delete all journal entries. Make sure to avoid clearing site data if you want to keep your journals!
