# Katrina's Journal 2026

A personalized digital journal and planner web app designed as a heartfelt gift for tracking moods, thoughts, and daily plans throughout 2026.

## About This Project

This project was created as a special gift for my girlfriend, Katrina, who wanted a digital planner with mood tracking capabilities. She designed the entire layout and aesthetic in Canva, featuring her preferred color palette, playful Filipino phrases, and a cozy handwritten style. I then brought her vision to life by coding it into a fully functional web application.

**Current Status**: This is an ongoing project! I'll be continuously updating and improving features based on feedback and usage.

  - Productive (•̀ ω •́)✧ - Pastel Green
- **Thought Dawter (Journal)** - Write and save daily journal entries with optional photo attachments
- **Anong Plano? (Planner)** - Paginated planner with 10 notes per page for organizing tasks and plans

## How to Use

### Option 1: Visit the Live Site
Go to: [https://raprap100.github.io/katrinas-journal-2026/](https://raprap100.github.io/Katrina-s-2026-Journal/)

### Option 2: Run Locally
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Start journaling

## Important Notes

- **Privacy First**: All journal entries and data are stored locally in your browser using localStorage. Nothing is ever sent to any server or database.
- **Device-Specific**: Data saved on one device won't automatically appear on another device. Each browser/device maintains its own separate journal.
- **Browser Data**: Clearing your browser's cache/data will delete all journal entries. Avoid clearing site data if you want to keep your journals.

## Roadmap / Future Updates

- Export journal entries to PDF or text file
- Import/backup functionality
- Search function for journal entries
- Cloud sync option for cross-device access
- Additional mood options
- Dark mode toggle
- Mobile app version
- Reminder notifications
